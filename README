connction_monitor.pl - written by Dexter Duncan

is a little perl program that is used to monitor
the status of a network connection.  We used it in the student workroom
when the students were complaining of wireless connections dropping.

Since there is an access point *in the room* I didn't think it was a 
network problem.  Used this program to see if that was true.  Ran it on
an old laptop and everything looked OK.
